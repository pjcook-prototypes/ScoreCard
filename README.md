# Score Card SwiftUI Demo

This is a demo app to show `redraw` performance improvements in SwiftUI.

The `Nieve` scene has no optimisations, and generated over 6000 view draws with just a few button clicks.
The `Better` scene improves on this,
and the `More better` scene tries to improve on that, although it is a WIP.
